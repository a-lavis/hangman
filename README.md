# hangman

Implementation of a hangman game in scheme.  
Can be played through the command line by running: run.scm  
Also includes an interface for other applications to use: interface.scm  

Other branches are extensions of this project:
I plan to use [Glitch](glitch.com) to make a webapp to play hangman on
the Glitch branch.
